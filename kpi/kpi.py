Performance Measurement and Backtesting

    We measure performance of the strategy by using historical data and mimicking
    actual trading conditions
    
    The main flawed assumption is that past can predict the future.
    
    Slippage, trading cost, brokerage, stop loss, etc. are all sometimes ignored during
    backtesting leading to poor test results and hence the strategy may not perform well
    in real scenarios.
    
    Some KPI's to measure the performance are:
        CAGR
        Annualized Volatility (StDev)
        Sharpe Ratio/ Sortino Ratio
        Maximum Drawdown
        Calmar Ratio
